* Lecture notes

## Grades
No exams.

* 50% - approximately 5 homeworks
* 25% - Labs on Wednesdays (not graded on attendance, submitted online, shorter than HW)
* 20% - Final project (due Wed, June 10)
   * like a "double homework"
   * more info later in the quarter
* 5% - Participation

## Homework
   * usually 1-2 weeks
   * will be accepted up to 2 days late
       * less than 24 hours late: 80% credit
       * 24-48 hours late: 60% credit
       * after 48 hours: no credit (0%)
   * contact the instructors in case of an emergency

## Labs

* Labs are required; need to be turned in at the end of the lab as a record of your attendance.
* Section attendance: try to stay with the time you are assigned on GOLD.
* Submit it by Friday at 5pm

## Participation
* Lecture attendance is strongly encouraged but not the only way to participate.
* join the lecture and ask questions (raise your hand on Zoom to be unmuted to ask your question)
* join the lab and ask questions
* participate on Piazza (asking/answering questions)
* office hours


## In-class group work
Will be split into groups of about 3 to introduce yourself and discuss the question that was posed.


Timestamp in the video 32:36

## Programming Languages for Data Science
* R (PSTAT 10), created specifically for statistical computing and graphics
* Python (CS 8), "general purpose" programming language + important packages


## Who is this class for?
* advanced beginners
* not for those who took advanced stats or cs courses

## Potential List of Topics
*

Taking computational / conceptional approach instead of the rigorous mathematical treatment

## What is a data scientist?
T vs $$\pi$$-shaped

## What is data science?
Domain expertise helps to know which tools to use and when.

Pokemon-card-style collection of data science explanation visualizations

## Learning from Data
* The way to learn about the world is to take a claim and prove that it's false.

* Induction. Can we generalize from specific instances?

* How is knowledge created from a sociological perspective?
  * science is a communal activity
  * e.g., threshold for p-values

## Falsification
$$H_0$$ (null hypothesis): "All swans are white."

vs.

$$H_A$$: "Not all swans are white."

$$H_0$$ (null hypothesis): "The ivory-billed woodpecker is extinct."

Can I be sure? Maybe I have been missing it.


## Induction and Evidence

* data provides _evidence_ for the truth of a conclusion
* argue about what is probable rather than what is impossible
* often about inferring general principles from specific observation
* Bayes' Theorem for describing probabilities based on evidence

Inference: "Black swans are rare." Fraction of black swans in the world?


## The role of models

* Make assumption about how the data is generated.
* Models can still be used to develop statistical tests
* Can also be used to make predictions / forecasts and describe sources of variability
* Can (and should) be continuously refined


## Statistical Inference

* probability (sampling distribution) ==> data ==> population

Given facts about the world, what might I see?

Learn the facts about the world

"Inverse probability"

## DS 100 philosophy

4 steps:
1. Raw data is not information (pandas)
2. Information is not knowledge (EDA)
	* ...
	* visualization (Altair)
3. Knowledge is not understanding (domain expertise)
4. Understanding is not wisdom (Ethical data science, consequences, data privacy)

### Wisdom and Data Science
Questions to ask yourself

Mark Twain's quote about statistics.

## Discussion
UC Berkeley Gender Bias case (1973)
- graduate school admissions

What possible truths are consistent with this information?
